<b>Notice Period / Termination:</b><br><br>



a.	Either party can terminate the contract of employment by giving 90 (Ninety) days notice in writing (subject further that such requirement shall extend to you during the tenure of probation period as well) subject to the Companyâ€™s right to pay salary in lieu thereof to you. The Company may also waive the requirement of serving notice period by you, either in full or part, solely at its own discretion and recover salary in lieu of notice period (pro rata if applicable) from you. However, should you sign any Service Agreement / undertaking with the company as a part of your employment process or later during the course of your employment with the company, you will then not be allowed to terminate your employment with the company unless you comply with the terms and conditions of the Service Agreement / Undertaking. <br><br>

b.	b.	It will be mandatory for you to serve the full notice period without taking any leave to help with complete hand over of all your responsibilities to an identified person. Any exceptions to this will be allowed only on 
Special approval of your BU head. In such cases your notice period and release date will be extended on a pro-rata basis to the extent of the leaves taken.

 <br><br>

c.	Company may, in certain circumstances, prefer to terminate your services without the notice period or a reduced notice period if there is a lack of business opportunity or your non competence, in such case, you will be paid salary in lieu of thereof for those many days<br><br>

d.	Similarly, if you are willing to serve the full notice period but the Company desires your early release for any reason, the Company will pay you salary in lieu of the relevant notice period.<br><br>

e.	e.	Your services are liable to be terminated forthwith without any notice or compensation or in the alternative, you shall be liable to disciplinary action and imposition of penalty in accordance with the Company Staff Rules if after your report for duty the Company receives information that you have prior to joining the Companyâ€™s services committed any act of misconduct, furnished fraudulent information or during your service in the Company, violated Company policy/ Code of conduct/ Staff Rules and regulations, Employment contract or if you are guilty of any act of misconduct, dishonesty, fraud, misdemeanor, which, in the opinion of the Company renders you unfit to serve in the Company.<br><br>

f.	Salary in all the above cases refers to Basic Salary.  <br><br>
